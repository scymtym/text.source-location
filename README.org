* TODO Introduction

* STARTED Concepts

  + sequence of characters :: E.g. a string (ignoring Unicode issues)

  + source :: A description (e.g. filename, buffer name) and,
              optionally, associated *sequence of characters*.

  + index :: Given a *sequence of characters*, before the first
             character, between two adjacent characters or after the
             last character. The index before the first character
             is 0.

  + position :: Abstract version of *index*.

                May be encoded as an *index* or as a *line* and a
                *column*.

  + range :: A pair of *positions* bounding a contiguous sub-sequence
             of a *sequence of characters*.

  + location :: A *source* and a *range*.

  + annotation :: A *location* and an annotation text.

  + line :: Vertical offset in lines from the beginning of the
            *sequence of characters*.

    + Internal representation :: [0, ∞)
    + User-facing represetation :: [1, ∞)

  + column :: A horizontal offset in characters from the beginning of
              the *line*.

    + Internal representation :: [0, ∞)
    + User-facing represetatnion :: [0, ∞)
